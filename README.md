#A fast Bresenham type algorithm for drawing filled ellipses
----

An C++ OpenGL implementation for drawing filled ellipses, based on a fast Bresenham type algorithm written by [Mr. John Kennedy](https://web.archive.org/web/20120225095359/http://homepage.smc.edu/kennedy_john/belipse.pdf)

####Dependencies:
- OpenGL 2.1
- freeglut
- GLEW

####Instructions:
Just run make, and execute the drawEllipse executable.

If you are looking for just a hollow ellipse, you could get it [here](https://github.com/notprathap/filled-ellipse/releases/tag/hollow-ellipse)

If you are looking for an implementation with lines, you could get it [here](https://github.com/notprathap/filled-ellipse/releases/tag/filled-ellipse-with-lines) - Please note not all pixels are painted within the ellipse, and hence the approach with triangles and quads

If you are looking for an implementation with traingles, you could get it [here](https://github.com/notprathap/filled-ellipse/releases/tag/filled-ellipse-with-triangles)
