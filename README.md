#A fast Bresenham type algorithm for drawing filled ellipses
----

An C++ OpenGL implementation for drawing filled ellipses, based on a fast bresenham type algorithm written by [Mr. John Kennedy](https://web.archive.org/web/20120225095359/http://homepage.smc.edu/kennedy_john/belipse.pdf)

####Dependencies:
- OpenGL 2.1
- freeglut
- GLEW

####Instructions:
Just run make, and execute the drawEllipse executable.

If you are looking for just a hollow ellipse, you could get it [here](https://github.com/notprathap/filled-ellipse/releases/tag/filled-ellipse-with-triangles)

If you are looking for the implementation with lines instead of traingles, you could get it [here](https://github.com/notprathap/filled-ellipse/releases/tag/filled-ellipse-with-lines) - Please note all pixels are painted within the ellipse, and hence the approach with traingles in the final version
